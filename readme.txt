Live clock in header

This modification helps to show a dynamic clock in the header of your forum, instead of static clock which comes with SMF.

All mod settings are available under
Admin center -> Configuration -> Live Clock Admin

To enable the mod go to following mentioned link and enable the mod
?action=admin;area=liveclock;

You can edit the timezone configurations from the following link
action=admin;area=liveclock;sa=displaytimezones

Note - If any of the 2 coloumns is left blank, the mod neglects the value of other column, i.e if you have entered value for 'Timezone Name' only but 'Timezone Difference' hasn't been filled. In that case mod neglects both values.


If you made any error while editing default timezone you can reset all the timezones to default values(which comes with the mod), by clicking 'Reset all timezones' from
Admin center -> Configuration -> Live Clock Admin
